# Odin_recipes
A simple webpage made during the foundations course on the Odin Project using HTML and CSS. Pancakes links are working, others are for learning. The layout idea was made on figma (the photos of it are in "Additional" folder)


Notes to self:
1. Desktop dimensions are not the same as website in figma (idea was to fit it into page, but now need to scroll a bit down).
2. Learn more of positioning, there has to be better way that checking different px values. Also need deeper dive in absolute and relative.
3. Fix something (positioning?) in such a way that the website doesn't break down when tab size is changed.
