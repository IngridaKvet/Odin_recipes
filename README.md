# Odin_recipes
A simple webpage made during the foundations course on the Odin Project using HTML and CSS. This repo contains all the files needed for example landing page described in The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum. <br>
The aim of this project was to create a simple website comprised of a homepage and three other pages, each containing a recipe. After completion I decided to update the website looks by adding  a layout and style (which I made using Figma) with the help of Flexbox and basic CSS. <br>
What I learnt: completing this project allowed me to practise working with Git and Github, creating simple HTML elements, adding some style with basic CSS and Flexbox.
